============

knuckle tattoo scrambles have been on my mind for a while now

fourLetterCombos.txt is a big list of results
	from scrambling combinations of 4 letter words
	and keeping those that result in a legit combination
	of 2 (1-7) letter words or 1 8 letter word.

checkWord.py is the script that resulted in fourLetterCombos.txt
	it will by default output a file called fourByFours.txt or something like that
	takes a long time to run because I was not a very good programmer when
	I wrote this. 

twl06.txt is the scrabble dictionary thing I used to check strings for "word" status

words(n).txt are lists of words that contain n letters
